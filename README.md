# BlurMonitor - Live Monitoring Tools for Backend Applications
BlurMonitor UI is based and forked from [Akveo](https://github.com/akveo "Akveo") talented team's [BlurAdmin](https://github.com/akveo/blur-admin "BlurAdmin").

### In a Nutshell
BlurMonitor is a client side web application* aimed to provide dynamic tools to get live status and monitoring statistics of a web application.

BlurMonitor connects to your servers via any endpoint providing JSON response and containing any data your would like to expose for monitoring. Then, this exposed JSON data can be used to build histogram graphs, pie charts, data tables and static monitoring values.
More on that on monitoring tools page.

\**Client side application* means that no data is stored on any server, all the configuration and monitoring profiles are stored on the user local machine using [HTML5 Web Storage](https://www.google.co.il/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiJh7rLsKzUAhVB1RoKHRIXDWMQFggmMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3schools.com%2Fhtml%2Fhtml5_webstorage.asp&usg=AFQjCNEZkSNg7SD0ortJ3k-9y2RmD82lHA&sig2=OKk-0DLJKAXH0Vm6eqlrYA "HTML5 Web Storage").
